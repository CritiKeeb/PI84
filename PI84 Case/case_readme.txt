These are the case files for the PI84 numpad! There is a top case, a bottom case, a microcontroller sled and a vent insert.
The top case includes six holes for M2x6 heat-set inserts, and the MCU sled includes a hole for an M2.5x3 insert. The insert in the sled is currently unused but I will model a piece to secure the USB C breakout, which will screw into this insert.
There are also some indentations on the bottom case for rubber feet.
Print five vent inserts in colors of your choice (have fun with this and match it to your keycap set!!)
I recommend using some tape to hold the vent inserts down before the MCU sled goes in
