# PI84
PI84 ("pee aye eighty-four"), a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) 30-key upgraded number pad, inspired by the key layout of the ubiquitous TI-8X line of graphing calculators!
This project is an excellent first handwiring project due to the small matrix size and ease of access into the bottom case
This firmware is based on that of the Minivan 40% keyboard because I am new to QMK and not quite ready to start from scratch yet.
    A huge thanks to them for that help!
    * The fourbytwelve framework is built on the Minivan QMK firmware

Example flash:
qmk flash -kb critikeeb/pieeightfour -km default
